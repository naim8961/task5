To analyze traffic accident data and identify patterns related to road conditions, weather, and time of day, follow these steps in a data analysis workflow:

Step 1: Data Acquisition

First, download the dataset from the provided Kaggle link:
US Accident Data Analysis

Ensure that you have access to the dataset and load it into your preferred data analysis environment (e.g., Jupyter Notebook, Google Colab, or Python environment).

Step 2: Load and Explore the Data

After loading the data, take a look at the first few rows to get a sense of its structure. In Python, you can use:

import pandas as pd

# Load dataset
data = pd.read_csv("us_accidents.csv")

# Check the first few rows
data.head()

The dataset likely contains features like Start_Time, End_Time, Weather_Condition, Road_Condition, Severity, Latitude, Longitude, etc.

Step 3: Data Cleaning

Before analysis, it’s essential to clean the dataset:
	•	Missing values: Check for missing or null values and decide whether to fill or drop them.
	•	Date and time: Convert the Start_Time and End_Time columns to datetime format for time-based analysis.
	•	Categorical features: Make sure that columns like Weather_Condition, Road_Condition, Severity are categorized appropriately.

# Check for missing values
data.isnull().sum()

# Convert Start_Time to datetime
data['Start_Time'] = pd.to_datetime(data['Start_Time'])

# Fill or drop missing values
data['Weather_Condition'].fillna('Unknown', inplace=True)

Step 4: Feature Engineering

Create new features to better analyze accident trends:
	•	Hour of Day: Extract the hour of the day from Start_Time for time-based analysis.
	•	Day of Week: Extract the day of the week.
	•	Accident Hotspot (Location): You can create accident hotspots by grouping accidents by geographical locations (e.g., using latitude and longitude).

# Extract hour and weekday from Start_Time
data['Hour_of_Day'] = data['Start_Time'].dt.hour
data['Day_of_Week'] = data['Start_Time'].dt.day_name()

Step 5: Analyze the Data

Now, you can begin your analysis. Here’s a breakdown of what to focus on:

1. Road Conditions and Weather

	•	Investigate how different weather conditions and road conditions correlate with accident severity and frequency.
	•	Use a pivot table or group-by approach to examine the counts.

# Group by weather and road condition to see patterns
weather_road_conditions = data.groupby(['Weather_Condition', 'Road_Condition']).size().unstack().fillna(0)

2. Time of Day and Day of Week

	•	Investigate accidents by hour of the day and day of the week to identify time-based patterns.

# Plot accidents by hour of the day
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

hourly_accidents = data.groupby('Hour_of_Day').size()
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
sns.lineplot(x=hourly_accidents.index, y=hourly_accidents.values)
plt.title('Accidents by Hour of Day')
plt.xlabel('Hour')
plt.ylabel('Number of Accidents')
plt.show()

# Plot accidents by day of week
daily_accidents = data.groupby('Day_of_Week').size()
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
sns.barplot(x=daily_accidents.index, y=daily_accidents.values)
plt.title('Accidents by Day of Week')
plt.xlabel('Day')
plt.ylabel('Number of Accidents')
plt.xticks(rotation=45)
plt.show()

3. Accident Hotspots

	•	Use geographical data (latitude and longitude) to create heatmaps or scatter plots showing the locations with the highest number of accidents.

import folium
from folium.plugins import HeatMap

# Filter data for plotting (for performance reasons, you might want to sample or filter out rows)
accident_data = data[['Latitude', 'Longitude']].dropna()

# Create a map centered around a central location
map_center = [accident_data['Latitude'].mean(), accident_data['Longitude'].mean()]
accident_map = folium.Map(location=map_center, zoom_start=10)

# Add heatmap layer
HeatMap(data=accident_data[['Latitude', 'Longitude']].values).add_to(accident_map)

# Save map to HTML or display
accident_map.save("accident_hotspots.html")

4. Severity Analysis

	•	Examine the relationship between weather, road conditions, and accident severity. You can visualize the severity distribution with respect to these factors.

# Severity vs Weather Condition
sns.boxplot(x='Weather_Condition', y='Severity', data=data)
plt.xticks(rotation=45)
plt.title('Accident Severity by Weather Condition')
plt.show()

# Severity vs Road Condition
sns.boxplot(x='Road_Condition', y='Severity', data=data)
plt.xticks(rotation=45)
plt.title('Accident Severity by Road Condition')
plt.show()

Step 6: Visualize the Patterns

Visualizations will give you insights into traffic accident trends:
	•	Heatmaps: Visualize accident hotspots geographically.
	•	Line/Bar plots: Show trends over time, such as accidents by hour of day or day of week.
	•	Box plots: Compare accident severity across different conditions (weather, road).

Conclusion:

This analysis will help identify:
	•	High-risk weather and road conditions for accidents.
	•	Times of day and days of the week with higher accident rates.
	•	Geographic hotspots for accidents.

By integrating these findings, you can propose interventions for road safety improvements, such as enhanced weather warnings, road condition monitoring, or better traffic control during high-risk times.
